# MediaTranscode Quality Score

> Baseline scope: `codex/rkmpp-zero-copy`, scored 2026-08-17. Task5 evidence was appended on 2026-08-26; numeric scores remain frozen until the required two independent reviewers complete the current branch review.

| Dimension | Max | Score | Evidence / debt |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Architecture and responsibility boundaries | 12 | 11 | Planner, builder, runtime validation and protocol output remain separated; the realtime surface is still broad. |
| Typed plans and planner authority | 12 | 12 | Backend, frame, transfer, filter, packetization and RTP ingress decisions are typed, serialized exactly and fail closed. |
| DAG shape and lifecycle | 10 | 8 | Strict shapes, bounded queues, RAII and source-loss propagation are preserved; bare RTP has no authoritative finite-source completion and RKMPP teardown remains noisy. |
| Zero-copy correctness | 14 | 14 | DRM PRIME format, planes, backing, dimensions and lineage are validated; original-size identity and RGA-only replacement are observed. |
| Protocol interoperability | 10 | 9 | H.264/HEVC separate RTP and H.265 SDP are real-media validated; broader receiver coverage remains. |
| A/V synchronization | 10 | 9 | Shared audio planner owns copy/transcode; synchronized output uses sample-domain correction with stable drift and zero drops. |
| Performance and resource bounds | 10 | 9 | RK VideoOnly averages 3.20% machine CPU with bounded 54 MB RSS; batched ingress reduced input calls and CPU, but long thermal soak is absent. |
| Diagnostics and error semantics | 8 | 8 | CPU/RSS, worker names, drift, DRM/RGA/transfer counters and final cause are explicit without suppressing target errors. |
| Cross-platform isolation | 7 | 5 | Shared code clean-builds on Windows; the Windows batched receive adapter and same-spec realtime acceptance remain frozen, not complete. |
| Maintainability and documentation | 7 | 6 | Planner materialization, adapter factory, plan decoder and receiver are separated; the overall realtime diff remains broad. |
| **Total** | **100** | **90** | **A-: RK VideoOnly is usable and bounded; lifecycle, Windows ingress and soak gates prevent a general production-ready claim.** |

## Task5 Datagram 发送控制证据增量（未重评分）

- 三类实时输出已统一为 protocol materializer、公共 service-scope `DatagramShaper` 和公共 nonblocking sender；file output 的 shape validator 明确排除 datagram 节点。
- `PreparedEncoderEmissionEnvelope`、`WireTrafficEnvelope`、graph/network resource ledger 与 receiver timing 产品均由 planner 形成；caller 不再提供 realtime queue、packet size、pacing rate、batch/backlog/endpoint/socket/correlation 或 startup preroll。
- exact `0084a3d1` 在 Windows VS2026 clean-first 与 RK Release clean-first `--parallel 8` 均成功；Windows CUDA/NVENC 与 RKMPP 的 1280×720@30、8 Mbps、H.264 raw RTP→HEVC MP2T/RTP 主链均完成不低于 30 秒发送窗口。
- RK/Windows 主链分别提交 26705/56310 datagrams；WouldBlock、deadline miss、pressure、partial/ambiguous submit 与 service-curve violation 均为 0。TX timestamp 未被平台 adapter tracked，按 report policy 如实记为 untracked，不能据此声称 wire completion。
- 本增量不提高现有分数：固定 120 秒 receiver loss/order/TS continuity、56 链路矩阵、两名独立 reviewer 同时 PASS 和 Task6 最终验收仍未完成。

## Remaining priorities

1. Define an authoritative bare-RTP finite-source completion contract without converting source-clock loss into success.
2. Implement the planned Windows completion-driven batch adapter and repeat the same 2K realtime chain.
3. Resolve RKMPP teardown diagnostics and run multi-hour RKMPP/RGA thermal and repeated-source soak.
4. Complete AudioVideo batched ingress after the VideoOnly gate without creating a separate media path.
